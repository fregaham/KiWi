The Mac OS X Distribution sores the certificates files in : "$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts"
This path differs from the linux (and I tend to say) classical one $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts.
This is the reason why there are two different server.xml files (one for mac os x 
and one for the rest).
